# Nango Cloud

## Get Started

[Sign up](https://nango.dev/start) to Nango Cloud and get your `Server URL` and `Secret` (don't share!).

On your local machine, configure them as environment variables (in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`):

```bash
export NANGO_HOSTPORT=SERVER_URL # Replace
export NANGO_SECRET_KEY=SECRET # Replace
```

‚ùóÔ∏è Restart your console to activate the new config.

üôå You can now follow the instructions from the [Step-By-Step Guide](reference/guide.md).
