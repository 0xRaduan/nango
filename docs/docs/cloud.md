## üöÄ Cloud Quickstart {#quickstart}

In <5mins, learn how to access & manage OAuth tokens for any API, using Github as an example. Ready? Go! ‚è∞

[Sign up](https://nango.dev/start) to Nango Cloud (no credit card required) and open the signup email you received from Nango.

Copy/paste the `Secret` from the signup email and run in your terminal (‚ùóÔ∏èreplace `<SECRET>`):

```bash
export NANGO_HOSTPORT=https://api.nango.dev && export NANGO_SECRET=<SECRET>
```

Register a new Github OAuth App (created by us) with Nango:

```bash
npx nango config:create github-cloud github 85e9ebdf0a725e006153 2e8c1a53c9d3684fef65ce214da241a6c041dc9b "user,public_repo"
```

Copy/paste the `Public Key` from the signup email and complete the Github [OAuth flow](https://docs.nango.dev/demo/github-cloud). Nango will securely retrieve, store and refresh OAuth credentials.

Now run:

```bash
npx nango token:get github-cloud 1
```

Congrats ü•≥ You have a fresh token to access the Github API! Let's make sure it works (‚ùóÔ∏èreplace `<TOKEN>`):

```bash
curl "https://api.github.com/users/bastienbeurier/repos" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
```

(In practice, you should use our [backend SDK](https://docs.nango.dev/reference/guide#node-sdk) or [REST API](https://docs.nango.dev/reference/guide#rest-api) to fetch tokens from your codebase.)
