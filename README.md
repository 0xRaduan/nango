## ‚≠ê Nango at a glance

Nango is a service that contains everything you need to work with APIs that use OAuth.

It contains:

-   a full OAuth dance for 50+ APIs
-   a frontend SDK to trigger new OAuth flows
-   a backend SDK & REST API to retrieve fresh access tokens for your API calls

Nango is easy to try in 5 minutes and can be deployed in 15:

-   1-liner to start a new OAuth flow in your frontend:

```ts
let result = await nango.auth('github', '<user-id>');
```

-   1-liner to retrieve a token (with our SDK or REST API):

```ts
let token = await nango.getToken('github', '<user-id>');
```

## üëæ Out of the box support for 50+ APIs

## üêª History

Pizzly (the original name of this project) was initially developed by the team at [Bearer](https://www.bearer.com/?ref=pizzly) with contributions of more than 40 individuals. Over time the focus of Bearer shifted and they could no longer maintain Pizzly. In late 2022 the team at [Nango](https://www.nango.dev) adopted the project and has since maintained and evolved it together with the growing Nango community.
