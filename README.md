## ‚≠ê Nango at a glance

Nango is a service that contains everything you need to work with APIs that use OAuth.

It contains:
- a full OAuth dance for 40+ APIs
- a frontend SDK to trigger new OAuth flows from your frontend
- a backend SDK & REST API to retrieve fresh access tokens for your API calls

Nango is easy to try in 5 minutes and can be deployed in 15:

- 1-liner to start a new OAuth flow in your frontend:
```ts
let result = await new Nango().auth('github', '<user-id>');
```

- 1-liner to retrieve a token (with our SDK or REST API):
```ts
let token = await nango.getToken('github', '<user-id>');
```

## üëæ Out of the box support for 40+ APIs

40+ APIs are preconfigured to work out-of-the-box. Including:
-   **CRM**: Front, Hubspot, Salesforce, etc.
-   **Accounting**: Xero, Sellsy, Zoho Books, etc.
-   **Developer tools**: GitHub, GitLab, Linear, Jira etc.
-   **Communication**: Gmail, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom etc.
-   **Productivity**: Asana, Airtable, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Trello, Google sheets, ClickUp etc.
-   **Social**: Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, Facebook etc.
-   [and more...](https://nango.dev/oauth-providers)

If your favorite API is missing [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/issues/new) or [contribute it right away](https://docs.nango.dev/contribute-api): The API configurations are just simple [entries in a YAML file](https://www.nango.dev/oauth-providers).

## üõ°Ô∏è Small, self-contained & ready for production

Nango is purposely small, focused on its one task and easy to deploy in production:

-   Runs as a single docker container
-   Updates easily (`docker pull`)
-   Secured with an API key
-   Managed with a CLI

Nango's community continuously maintains & expands API templates.

## üöÄ¬†Quickstart

Clone the repo and start Nango:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango.git && cd nango
docker compose up
```

Make sure you have a client ID & secret ready for the API you want to use, e.g. for GitHub [register here](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app). Use `http://localhost:3003/oauth/callback` as the callback URL.

In a new terminal window, configure a new Github integration with our CLI (outside the `nango` repo):
```bash
cd ~ && npx nango config:create github github <client-id> <client-secret> "user,public_repo"
```

In a new terminal window, go to the `nango` repo and serve the demo page: 
```bash
cd packages/frontend && python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Go to the demo [page](http://localhost:8080/bin/quickstart.html) and start an OAuth flow with `github`¬†as the config key and¬†`1`¬†as the connection ID.

Finally, fetch a fresh access token to make API calls with the API:
```bash
curl -XGET -G \
  'http://localhost:3003/connection/1' \
  -d provider-config_key=github
```

or with Node:
```bash
npm i nangohq/node
```
```ts
import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';
let nango = new Nango();
var githubAccessToken = await nango.accessToken('github', '1');
```

Et voil√† ! Nango will permanently store & refresh your tokens safely. For production usage, read our docs about [Self-Hosted](https://docs.nango.dev/category/deploy-nango-sync-open-source) & [Cloud](https://docs.nango.dev/cloud) options.

## üêª History

Pizzly was originally developed by the team at [Bearer](https://www.bearer.com/?ref=pizzly) with contributions of more than 40+ individuals. Over time the focus of Bearer shifted and they could no longer maintain Pizzly. In late 2022 the team at [Nango](https://www.nango.dev) adopted the project and has since maintained and evolved it together with the growing Nango community.
